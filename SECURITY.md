# LawFly Pro Security Architecture

## Overview

LawFly Pro implements a **zero-trust, security-first architecture** designed specifically for legal industry requirements. Every aspect of the system is built with security as the primary consideration, not an afterthought.

## üèóÔ∏è **Security Architecture Principles**

### 1. Zero-Trust by Default
- **Never trust, always verify** - Every request is authenticated and authorized
- **Continuous verification** - Device posture and risk assessment on every request
- **Least privilege access** - Users get minimum permissions required for their role
- **Network segmentation** - Microsegmentation with service mesh

### 2. Multi-Tenant Isolation
- **Namespace-level isolation** - Each tenant operates in isolated environment
- **Row-level security (RLS)** - Database-enforced tenant boundaries
- **Encryption key isolation** - Separate keys per tenant (BYOK support)
- **VPC-per-tenant option** - Network isolation for enterprise customers

### 3. Defense in Depth
- **Multiple security layers** - Authentication, authorization, encryption, monitoring
- **Fail-safe defaults** - Secure by default, explicit permissions required
- **Security controls validation** - Continuous compliance monitoring
- **Incident response ready** - Automated detection and response capabilities

## üîê **Authentication & Authorization**

### Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- **TOTP-based MFA** using industry-standard algorithms
- **Backup codes** for recovery scenarios
- **WebAuthn/FIDO2 support** for passwordless authentication
- **Risk-based MFA** - Dynamic MFA requirements based on risk scoring

### Single Sign-On (SSO)
- **SAML 2.0** integration with enterprise identity providers
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC)** for modern authentication flows
- **Automatic user provisioning** with SCIM 2.0 protocol
- **Just-in-time (JIT) provisioning** for streamlined onboarding

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
```typescript
// Example role structure
const roles = {
  'managing-partner': {
    permissions: ['*'],
    restrictions: ['audit-logs:delete']
  },
  'attorney': {
    permissions: [
      'matters:read,write,delete',
      'clients:read,write', 
      'documents:read,write',
      'billing:read,write'
    ]
  },
  'paralegal': {
    permissions: [
      'matters:read,write',
      'documents:read,write',
      'research:*'
    ]
  }
}
```

### Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
- **Dynamic authorization** based on user, resource, and environmental attributes
- **Context-aware policies** considering time, location, device trust
- **Fine-grained permissions** at field and record level
- **Policy-as-code** using Open Policy Agent (OPA)

## üîë **Encryption & Key Management**

### Bring Your Own Key (BYOK)
- **Customer-controlled encryption** using AWS KMS customer-managed keys
- **Key isolation** - Each tenant can use their own encryption keys
- **Hardware Security Module (HSM)** support for enterprise customers
- **Key rotation** - Automated and manual key rotation capabilities

### Field-Level Encryption
```typescript
// Example of field-level encryption for sensitive data
const encryptedField = await encryptionService.encryptField(
  'john.doe@example.com',    // value
  'email',                   // field type
  tenantId,                  // tenant context
  customerKmsKeyId           // customer's key
);
```

### Encryption Standards
- **AES-256-GCM** for symmetric encryption
- **RSA-4096** for asymmetric encryption where needed
- **TLS 1.3** for all network communication
- **Encrypted at rest** - All databases, file storage, and backups
- **Encrypted in transit** - All internal and external communication

## üõ°Ô∏è **Data Protection**

### Data Classification
- **Public** - Marketing materials, public legal documents
- **Internal** - Internal policies, non-sensitive business data
- **Confidential** - Client information, legal strategies, privileged communications
- **Restricted** - PHI, PII, financial data, highly sensitive legal matters

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- **Content inspection** - Automated detection of sensitive data patterns
- **Policy enforcement** - Block/quarantine based on configurable rules
- **Email protection** - Scan outbound emails for sensitive content
- **Upload scanning** - Virus scan and content analysis on file uploads

### Privacy Controls
- **Data minimization** - Collect and store only necessary data
- **Consent management** - Track and manage consent for data processing  
- **Right to erasure** - Cryptographic erasure using key destruction
- **Data portability** - Export capabilities for GDPR compliance

## üîç **Audit & Compliance**

### Immutable Audit Trail
- **Hash-chained events** - Tamper-proof audit log using cryptographic hashes

- **Integrity verification** - Automated verification of audit trail integrity

### Audit Event Structure
