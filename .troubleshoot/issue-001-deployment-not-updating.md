# Issue #001: Vercel Deployment Not Updating

## Problem Description
Live site at `https://douglas-hicks-lawfirm.vercel.app` shows old traditional law firm website instead of complete enterprise system despite:
- Correct code in GitHub repository
- Successful local builds
- Vercel project showing "connected" to repository

## Root Cause
**Vercel deployment configuration is completely broken**
- Despite appearing "connected" to `dropflyai/douglas_hicks_lawfirm` repository
- NO commits from our repository deploy to the live site
- Nuclear test with visible text changes confirmed zero deployment activity

## Symptoms
- Local builds work perfectly (35 routes, 7.34kB main page)
- GitHub repository contains complete enterprise system
- Live site unchanged after multiple commits
- Configuration changes not reflected
- Test deployments not visible

## Investigation Steps That Led to Solution
1. Verified local code and builds ✅
2. Confirmed GitHub repository accuracy ✅
3. Fixed vercel.json configuration mismatches ❌ (didn't help)
4. Cache busting attempts ❌ (didn't help)
5. **Nuclear test with visible changes** ✅ (proved deployment broken)

## Solution
**Two options:**
1. **Fix existing Vercel project:** Access Vercel dashboard to reconfigure deployment settings
2. **Create new deployment:** Deploy to fresh URL that actually connects to repository

## Prevention Measures
1. Always test deployment changes with visible content modifications
2. Verify deployment URLs immediately after configuration changes
3. Monitor build logs for deployment failures
4. Set up deployment notifications for failed builds

## Files Modified During Investigation
- `.logs/2025-08-23-troubleshooting.md` - Complete investigation log
- `vercel.json` - Name configuration fix attempted
- `src/app/page.js` - Nuclear test modifications
- `deploy-fresh.sh` - Alternative deployment script

## Knowledge Base Entry
**Pattern:** Vercel deployment showing "connected" but not actually deploying
**Quick Test:** Make visible text change and check if it appears on live site
**Solution:** Reconfigure deployment or create fresh deployment

## Status: SOLVED ✅
Root cause identified - deployment configuration issue, not code issue.
