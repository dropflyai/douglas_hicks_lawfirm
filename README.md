# LawFly Pro - Security-First Legal Operations Platform

**The first legal platform built for firms that take security seriously.**

## 🔐 Security-First Architecture

LawFly Pro is built from the ground up with enterprise-grade security that goes far beyond what traditional legal platforms offer:

- **🔑 Customer-Controlled Encryption (BYOK)** - You own your encryption keys, not us
- **🛡️ Zero-Trust Architecture** - Continuous verification, never trust
- **🔒 Immutable Audit Trail** - Tamper-proof logging with hash-chain verification
- **🏢 Provable Multi-Tenant Isolation** - Cryptographically verified data separation
- **📊 Real-Time Compliance Monitoring** - Always audit-ready, never audit-stressed
