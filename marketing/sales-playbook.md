## Closing Techniques

### The Security Assumption Close
*"Based on what you've shared about your security requirements and client demands, it sounds like the Professional tier with BYOK encryption would be the right fit. Should we start with a 30-day pilot to prove the security value?"*

### The Competitive Urgency Close  
*"Your biggest competitor just signed with a security-first platform. How quickly can we get you deployed so you're not at a disadvantage in client pitches?"*

### The Risk Mitigation Close
*"You mentioned that a security breach would cost you $2-3M in direct costs plus reputational damage. For $400/month per attorney, you're essentially buying insurance that also provides competitive advantage. Isn't that the easiest decision you'll make this year?"*

### The BYOK Control Close
*"You've told me that control over client data is critical. With our BYOK encryption, you maintain complete control - you can even revoke our access instantly if needed. No other platform gives you that level of control. Are you ready to take back control of your data?"*

### The Compliance Confidence Close
*"Your next SOC 2 audit is in six months. Would you rather spend the next six months scrambling to gather evidence manually, or walk into that audit with automated compliance monitoring and pre-collected evidence? Which scenario gives you more confidence?"*
