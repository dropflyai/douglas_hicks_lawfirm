# LawFly Pro Platform Migration
**From Demo to Production Platform**

## Migration Overview
Transforming the Douglass Hicks Law Firm demo into the LawFly Pro security-first legal operations platform.

## Phase 1: Repository Transformation
1. **Backup existing demo** - Preserve current demo functionality
2. **Add LawFly Pro security foundation** - Integrate security-first architecture
3. **Update branding and messaging** - Transform from demo to platform
4. **Maintain demo as reference client** - Douglass Hicks becomes first customer showcase

## Files to Migrate from lawfly-pro Directory:
- `/infrastructure/` - Complete AWS security infrastructure
- `/services/` - Authentication and compliance services  
- `/marketing/` - Sales materials and competitive analysis
- `/compliance/` - SOC 2 preparation and frameworks
- `/scripts/` - Deployment and onboarding automation
- `SECURITY.md` - Security architecture documentation

## Repository Renaming Strategy:
1. **GitHub Repository Name:** `dropflyai/douglas_hicks_lawfirm` â†’ `dropflyai/lawfly-pro-platform`
2. **Project Description:** Update to reflect security-first platform
3. **README:** Transform from demo-specific to platform-wide
4. **Maintain Demo:** Douglass Hicks demo becomes subdirectory `/demos/douglass-hicks/`

## Deployment Strategy:
- **Current Vercel:** Update project name to `lawfly-pro-platform`
- **Domain:** Transition to `lawfly.pro` (keep demo at `douglass-hicks.lawfly.pro`)
- **Environment:** Production-ready with security foundation

## Next Steps:
1. Copy LawFly Pro security files to this repository
2. Update package.json and project configuration  
3. Restructure as multi-tenant platform with demo as first tenant
4. Deploy unified platform to production

**This approach leverages existing work while building the complete platform!**
