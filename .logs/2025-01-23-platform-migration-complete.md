## Migration Strategy: Demo to Platform âœ…

### âœ… Successfully Migrated:
Instead of creating a separate repository, we strategically transformed the existing Douglass Hicks Law Firm demo into the complete LawFly Pro security-first platform. This approach:

- **Preserves existing work** - Maintains all demo functionality and git history
