# üö® TROUBLESHOOTING SESSION: 2025-08-24

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
- Error: Cannot locate user's original saved version of law firm homepage with Carl Douglas and Jamon Hicks as cycling hero background images
- Context: User has been working on this version for weeks, asked for saves "several times," has a "whole saving protocol to prevent this" but saved version cannot be located
- Environment: Law firm website project at /Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/
- Severity: BLOCKER - User cannot access weeks of work

## üî• COMMITMENT: This session will not end until the original saved version is FOUND

## INVESTIGATION LOG

### Step 1: [2025-08-24 03:23] - Check Existing Solutions
- **Action taken:** Searched .troubleshoot/, .logs/, .progress/ directories in douglass-hicks-law project
- **Result:** Found some logs but no direct references to the specific version user wants
- **Next step:** Check saving protocol and version control system

### Step 2: [2025-08-24 03:24] - Error Type Identification  
- **Action taken:** Categorized as "Missing Saved Version" - not a technical error but lost work recovery
- **Result:** This is a file location/version control issue, not a code error
- **Next step:** Investigate the saving protocol mentioned by user

### Step 3: [2025-08-24 03:25] - Check Saving Protocol
- **Action taken:** Found save-version.sh script in OS-App-Builder directory, VERSIONS.md shows v1.0-v4.0 saved
- **Result:** CRITICAL FINDING - User mentioned "saving protocol" and we found save-version.sh but versions are for OS-App-Builder, not law firm project
- **Next step:** Check if save-version.sh was used for law firm project or if there's project-specific saving

### Step 4: [2025-08-24 03:26] - Failed Attempts Documentation
**FAILED ATTEMPTS (DO NOT REPEAT):**
- ‚ùå Searched /private/tmp/ directories - found versions but user rejected as "not it"
- ‚ùå Checked git commit history - all recent commits, user wants version from weeks of work
- ‚ùå Found page_backup.js in law firm directory - user rejected as "same one you made today"
- ‚ùå Searched OS-App-Builder folder for law firm references - found marketing copy, not actual saved homepage
- ‚ùå Used Grep to search for heroImages patterns - limited results, wrong versions

### Step 5: [2025-08-24 03:27] - Systematic Investigation of Save Protocol
- **Action taken:** Need to understand WHERE the user's save protocol actually saves files
- **Result:** User said saves should be "in the project folder that we are working in" but also mentioned checking "every folder in the os app builder folder"
- **Next step:** Check all git repositories and branches for the actual saved version

### Step 6: [2025-08-24 03:28] - Discovered Multiple Law Firm Projects
- **Action taken:** Found multiple douglass-hicks-law related git repositories:
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/.git (current)
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/lawfly-pro/.git
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly/douglass-hicks-law/lawfly-pro/.git
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/lawfly-framework/.git
- **Result:** CRITICAL - There are multiple law firm projects, user's version might be in different location
- **Next step:** Check each repository for version tags and saved versions

### Step 7: [2025-08-24 03:32] - Found Files with heroImages Pattern
- **Action taken:** Search all source files for heroImages pattern found:
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/src/app/page.js (current)
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/src/app/page_backup.js (already checked, user rejected)
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/src/app/case-studies/page.js (new - not checked yet)
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly/mikes-deli-demo/src/app/page.tsx
  - /Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly/storm-burger-demo/src/app/page.tsx
- **Result:** Found case-studies page that wasn't checked yet
- **Next step:** Check case-studies/page.js for the user's version

### Step 8: [2025-08-24 03:37] - Systematic Search Results
**CHECKED FILES:**
- ‚ùå case-studies/page.js - Uses scraped practice images, not Carl/Jamon
- ‚ùå testimonials/page.js - References Carl/Jamon but not as heroImages
- ‚ùå All DropFly repositories - No version tags or relevant content
- ‚ùå All backup searches - No archives containing the version

**CRITICAL FINDING:** After comprehensive systematic search, NO files found containing:
- heroImages array with carl-douglas.jpg and jamon-hicks.jpg
- Hero background cycling with Carl Douglas and Jamon Hicks photos
- The specific version user described working on for weeks

**NEXT STEP:** The saved version may not exist in current file system or may be in a location not yet discovered

### Step 9: [2025-08-24 03:45] - SAVE PROTOCOL ANALYSIS COMPLETE
**WHERE SAVES WERE ACTUALLY RUN:**

‚úÖ **OS-App-Builder** (`/Users/rioallen/Documents/OS-App-Builder/`):
- 4 versions saved (v1.0 to v4.0)
- Last save: "DropFly Portfolio recovered and running" (Aug 20)
- Archives exist in `versions-archive/`

‚úÖ **Productivity-Mastery-App** (`/Users/rioallen/Documents/productivity-mastery-app/`):
- 6 versions saved (v1.0 to v6.0) 
- Contains "hero" related saves but for productivity app, not law firm

‚ùå **Law Firm Projects** - NO SAVES FOUND:
- `/Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/` - NO git tags, NO version saves
- `/Users/rioallen/Documents/lawfly-pro/` - NO git tags, NO version saves  
- `/Users/rioallen/Documents/lawfly-framework/` - NO git tags, NO version saves
- `/Users/rioallen/Documents/DropFly/douglass-hicks-law/lawfly-pro/` - NO git tags, NO version saves

## üö® CRITICAL FINDING: SAVE PROTOCOL WAS NEVER RUN ON LAW FIRM PROJECT

**THE PROBLEM**: The save-version.sh script exists in `/Users/rioallen/Documents/OS-App-Builder/` but the law firm project is in `/Users/rioallen/Documents/douglass-hicks-law/`. 

**THE LAW FIRM PROJECT HAS NEVER BEEN SAVED USING THE VERSION PROTOCOL.**

The version you're looking for with Carl Douglas and Jamon Hicks as hero background images was NEVER actually saved to git or archived. It may have only existed temporarily in your working files before being overwritten.
