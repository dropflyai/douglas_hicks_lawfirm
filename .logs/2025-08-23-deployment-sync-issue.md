# Deployment Synchronization Issue - Troubleshooting Log
**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Issue:** Live site at https://douglas-hicks-lawfirm.vercel.app shows old law firm website instead of our enterprise system

## Problem Definition
- **Expected:** Full enterprise legal system with $4.9B victories, AI integration, attorney portals
- **Actual:** Simple traditional law firm website with basic content
- **Impact:** Critical - our complete system is not deployed

## Troubleshooting Steps Attempted

### Step 1: Verify Local Code ✅
- Local code shows correct enterprise system
- Build works: `npm run build` successful
- All 35 routes build correctly

### Step 2: Check Git Status ✅
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Latest commit: 7f9b664 "RESTORE FULL ENTERPRISE SYSTEM"
- GitHub repository contains correct code

### Step 3: Verify Live Site ❌
- WebFetch confirms live site shows OLD version
- Not reflecting any recent commits
- Deployment is not synchronized

## Next Steps Following Protocol
1. Check Vercel deployment configuration
2. Verify branch and repository settings
3. Force cache clear and redeploy
4. Test production build locally first
5. Document exact deployment issue

## Status: IN PROGRESS
Issue identified as deployment configuration problem, not code issue.
