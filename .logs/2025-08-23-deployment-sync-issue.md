# Deployment Synchronization Issue - Troubleshooting Log
**Date:** August 23, 2025
**Issue:** Live site at https://douglas-hicks-lawfirm.vercel.app shows old law firm website instead of our enterprise system

## Problem Definition
- **Expected:** Full enterprise legal system with $4.9B victories, AI integration, attorney portals
- **Actual:** Simple traditional law firm website with basic content
- **Impact:** Critical - our complete system is not deployed

## Troubleshooting Steps Attempted

### Step 1: Verify Local Code ✅
- Local code shows correct enterprise system
- Build works: `npm run build` successful
- All 35 routes build correctly

### Step 2: Check Git Status ✅
- All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- Latest commit: 7f9b664 "RESTORE FULL ENTERPRISE SYSTEM"
- GitHub repository contains correct code

### Step 3: Verify Live Site ❌
- WebFetch confirms live site shows OLD version
- Not reflecting any recent commits
- Deployment is not synchronized

## Next Steps Following Protocol
1. Check Vercel deployment configuration
2. Verify branch and repository settings
3. Force cache clear and redeploy
4. Test production build locally first
5. Document exact deployment issue

## Protocol Steps Completed ✅

### Step 1: Local Build Test ✅
- `npm run build` successful - 35 routes, main page 7.34kB
- Production build contains full enterprise system

### Step 2: Production Server Test ✅  
- Local production server running on port 3022
- Confirmed enterprise system works locally

### Step 3: GitHub Verification ✅
- Latest commit 9984501 confirmed on GitHub
- Repository contains correct enterprise code
- All recent commits present

### Step 4: Force Deployment ✅
- Version bump to 1.0.2 to force rebuild
- New commit pushed to trigger Vercel cache clear

### Step 5: Multiple URL Testing ❌
- douglas-hicks-lawfirm.vercel.app still shows old version
- Alternative URLs return 404/401 errors
- No automatic sync occurred

## CRITICAL FINDING
**Root Cause Identified:** The Vercel project at `douglas-hicks-lawfirm.vercel.app` is NOT connected to our GitHub repository or is deploying from a different source. 

**Evidence:**
1. Our GitHub has correct code ✅
2. Our local builds work perfectly ✅  
3. Live site unchanged after multiple commits ❌
4. Alternative Vercel URLs don't exist ❌

**Solution Required:** Manual Vercel dashboard configuration to:
- Connect correct repository: dropflyai/douglas_hicks_lawfirm
- Set correct branch: main  
- Verify build settings
- Trigger manual deployment

## Status: DEPLOYMENT CONFIGURATION ISSUE CONFIRMED
Protocol completed successfully - Code is correct, deployment platform needs reconfiguration.
